### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
There were two total analysis conducted, which are analysis of outcomes based on launch date and outcomes based on the goals.
For analysis of outcomes based on launch date, pivot table and pivot chart were created in order to carefully look at the outcomes based on  
Launch date. First of all, pivot table was created from the data set where "parent cateogry" and "years" were filtered. Since the main goal was
to analyze the outcome of theater from the parent category based on the launching date, "Date created conversion" went to the rows sections whereas
"outcomes" was put into the columns section. Furthermore, parent category was filtered  so that the trend of theater could be shown. Afterwards,
pivot chart was created to visualize the the overall trend of the outcome based on the launching date, line graph was used since it was believed that
line graph would show the trend most clearly. 

### Election-Audit Summary
It was well shown that this script can find various information very quickly including the total number of votes, number of votes for county and candidates as well as percentage of each candidate's vote from the election. It can also be useful for other elections including presidential election since it can allow Election commission to quickly find the percentage of votes for party as well as candidates. Furthermore, it can be useful for exit poll, which allows parties to analyze various things for upcoming elections.
